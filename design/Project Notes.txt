Property
1.) User RDBMS
2.) No need HTML formatting, use only JSON objects
3.) Basic authentication with every request
4.) Services running on HTTPS
5.) No encryption of messages
6.) Deploy, scale, and monitor
7.) Graceful shutdown of individual containers
8.) Transactional consistency
9.) git Integration

Testing
1.) Test using POSTMAN.

}

2. Customer Account service

{
 //Account details for opening savings accounts
}

3. Money transfer service

POST https://localhost/transfer
{
 "fromAccount" : <Account Number>,
 "toAccount"   : <Account Number>
 "Amount"      : <Amount>
}

Response
{
  //Response depicting failure or success of transfer operation
}

Security
